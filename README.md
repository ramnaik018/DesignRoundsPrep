## There can be Two cases

  3. How will i interact with the user (will it be using REST API / Hardcode input/ Command Line)?
  4. Do you want me persist the data?

  # Step1: Gathering and clarifying the requirements
  --- If the question is a single line statement , ofcourse we should gather the requirments and make a PRD. Else if we already have a PRD given , we can directly jump to clarifying the requirements.
  **Below are the steps to build a PRD :**
    1. suggest ideas/features and ask if they are required? (5-8 features)
        - To get Ideas try to visualise what the products lifecyle looks like and what it does.
        - Dont try to be oversmart and suggest basic requirements for a **minimum viable product** which you can do.
